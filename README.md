### dev-mary-lab: quan demo notes
- Knowledge management system 
- Demo has dummy data and after production data will be updated  
- Admin side to update and delete professors just like how we update and delete posts on our project 
- Ssh -  to access remotely  
- In-house infrastructure using dynamic DNS – static (public) IP is the IP that is given to your house or business  
- They also give you a dynamic IP 
- No.ip - to access home  
- Namecheap 
- Reverse proxy 
- Firebase – frontend external  
- Hosting servers issues, bad weather and external problems 
- Cloudzy cheaper than azure or google  
- Ejs and svelte  

### One Concept to learn about .... Svelte
- What is Svelte, how do we use it, and how does it relate to dev-mary?

Svelte is a modern JavaScript Framework used to build user interfaces, a little different from traditional frameworks such as React and Vue. It takes a complier first approach, meaning most of the work is done during the build time, therefore, resulting in smalled/faster and more optimized applications. Svelte is a lot less "wordy" and  very lean which means you can code more efficent and not have to worry about syntax. It also includes various tools and features that make development go very smoothly. You should use Svelte when building lightweight web pages that need high performance and smaller bundle sizes, prototyping quickly, and projects that need interactive UI's. 
The only thing I can connect from svelte and dev-mary, is that we could use svelte to create a similar project that would offer several advatages. For my dev-mary, svelte reactivity system allows the UI to automatically update whenever there is a change. Since we are adding and deleting items, svelte can handle that in a cleaner and intiutive way. Another advantage is that svelte can interact with backend API's easily like Express server and use fetch to requests to get or post data to MongoDB.
